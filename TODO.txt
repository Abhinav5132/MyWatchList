Backend:
    -voice actors need to be incorporated
    -change it to large pictures 
    -add tag percentages
    -id might not be safe enough look at using username for hashing
    - right now the user can only have one session because when a user logs in again the current token is replaced. and if it replaced their other session gets terminated.
    so use the date to check if the previous token is valid and if it is create a new entry with the token. Also maybe we can use the ip address where the request is coming from 
    to issue new tokens if the user is on a different device or even their platform.
Frontend:
    -kinda fixed the css problem but i need to make sure every id and class name are distinct
    -if name is too long do ... the causes the image cards to become too big in the search page 
    -Friends is gonna have 5 items max and the rest needs to have its own Friends page
    -Clicking on a friend liking it should also take them to a different page with when they added ect and their other likes/watches
    -trash can image is not the right image.
    -plus icon needs to be replaced.
    -rename details page css names.
    -add a showing results for on search page.
    -fix the load_times for images somehow // need to switch to serving smaller images 
    -fix pfp.
    -if already loged_in and then login again the userid dosent refresh unless u close the app.
