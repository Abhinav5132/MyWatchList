Backend:
    -Banner images havent been added to the database for some reason. IDK if they will ever be used so low Priority fix.
    -Also need to get the english title.
    -tags need to be replaced with generes
    -fetch character portraits.
    -recommendations are duplicted multiple times for some reason
    -make it so the data get updated from anilist every week and build the database on the fly and swap to that instance and delete old, this requires a dual databse
Frontend:
    -When you return back from details page to search page the css styling is fucked, prolly because its trying to use details_page.css for some odd reason
    -if name is too long do ... the causes the image cards to become too big in the search page 
    -Friends is gonna have 5 items max and the rest needs to have its own Friends page
    -Clicking on a friend liking it should also take them to a different page with when they added ect and their other likes/watches
    -trash can image is not the right image
    -plus icon needs to be replaced

Final:
    -need to bundle gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly for linux or equivalent for other systems
